# Metacash.js (WIP)

Metacash.js is a library written in Typescript that creates and interacts with Metacash Smart Wallets via the Metacash Relayer API.

Currently, only gasless token meta-transfers are supported. In the future, support for abstract transactions to arbitrary contracts will be added.

The library is a Work In Progress and should not yet be used in production.

## Usage

1. Compile to Javascript
`npm run build`

2. Import /lib/index.js
